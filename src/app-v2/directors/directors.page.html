             <h5 class="my-0">Chris Moody</h5>
             <small>BOARD MEMBER</small>
             <p>BIO: Dr. Moody wears lots of ministry hats but the one he is most proud of and the one he often says he will give up last is as a personal disciple maker. Chris currently serves as the lead pastor of Beaumont’s First Baptist Church and as an Assistant Professor of Systematic Theology for Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary in Lynchburg, VA. Dr. Moody continues to guide FBC Beaumont, an historic church founded in 1872, through a major shift in focus from a traditional SBC model of ministry to a ‘Making-DiscipleMakers’ model of ministry. Numerous onlookers throughout this ‘discipleshift’ have given the same refrain: “If First Beaumont can do it, any church can do it.”</p>
